Crackinga puzzle
DID dinosaureggshatch quickly, like
those ofbirds(which are dinosaurs’
directdesce
ndants), orslowl
y, like those
ofmodern reptiles(whic
h are din
osaurs’
collateral cousins
)? Thatisthe question
addressed byGregoryErickson ofFlorida
State Universityand hiscolleagues in a

paperjustpublished 
in the Proceedingsof
the National AcademyofSciences
. Itis
pertinentbecause ittoucheson the wider

matterofjusthow“
reptilian” the dino-
saursactuallywere. Researchersalready

knowthatmanywere warm-blooded,

and thatsome had insulation in the form

offeathers, even though theycould not

ﬂy. Fast-developingembryoswould drive

afurtherwedge between them and their

trulyreptilian kin.
To investigate, DrErickson looked at
two setsoffossili
sed dinosaureggs. The
ﬁrst, from a Mongolian nest(pictured),
waslaid by
Protoceratopsandrewsi
, asheep-sized creature thatl
ived 70m years
ago. The second, from Ca
nada, waslaid
byHypacrosaurusstebingeri
—a species
contemporarywith 
P. andrewsi
thatgrew
to somethingbetween the weightsof a

rhinocerosand an elephant. 
In each case the researchersused an
X-rayscannerto examine the teeth of
embryosfound insi
de the eggs. In cross-
section, dinosaurtee
th displaygrowth
rings, called von Ebnerlines
, that are
reminiscentofthe annual growth rings

ofa tree trunk. In all livingspecies which

have von Ebnerlinesthose linesrepre-

senta day’sgrowth. Ittherefore seems

reasonable to believe thatthiswas true

fordinosau
rsaswell.
Assumingalso, asDrErickson and his
colleaguesdi
d, thatdinosau
rs’ teeth
began to growabouthalfwaythrough

embryonicdevelopment(which iswhen

acrocodile’sembryonicteeth ﬁrstap-

pear), theyconclude thatthe 
P. andrewsi
eggstheylooked atwere about83 days

old, makingthatthe lowerbound of their

incubation period. Thiscompareswith

the 42 daysan ostrich eggtakesto in-

cubate and 
the 200-plusdaysrequired by
aKomodo dragon egg—both ofthese

animalsbeing, when adult, ofcompara-

ble size to 
P. andrewsi
. The biggereggsof
H. stebingeri
need-ed, accordingto DrErickson’scalcula-

tions, a minimum of171daysincubation.

Sadly, no e
gg-layinganimal 
ofitssize is
around todayforcomparison. Butprojec-

tionsbased on 
size and incubation-
period data from modern birdsand

reptiles
suggest171days
issubstantially
more than would be expected ifthe eggs

ofH. stebingeri
were developingin a
birdlike way.
The truth, then, isthatin thisas in
othermatte
rs, din
osaursar
e lessr
eptilianthan wasonce thought, butnotasavian

assome revis
ionistsw
ould like to be-
lieve. Amessyanswer, perhaps. But, in

nature, thingsare notalwaysclear-cut.
Howreptilian were
 dinosaureggs?
Adinosaur’s nest
IN2015, a bitovertwo yearsafterHurri-
cane Sandyhithisci
ty, Bill 
de Blasio,NewYork’smayor, announced the cre-
ation ofa $3 billion restoration fund. Part

ofthe moneyisintended to payforsea

wallsthatwill help protectthe place from

future storms. 
Buildingsuch wallsmaybe an even
more timelymove 
than Mrde Blasio
thoughtwhen he made hisannounce-

ment. Asa paper
justpublis
hed in Nature
explains, forthe pasttwo decadesa natural

form ofprotection mayhave been shield-

ingAmerica’sAtlantic
coast, stoppi
ng bigstormsarriving. Such protection, though, is

unlikelyto 
lastforever. Mrde Blasio isthus
takingthe prudentcourse ofmendingthe

roofwhile the sun isshining.
The studyin question wasconducted
byJamesK
ossin ofAmerica’sNational
Oceanicand 
Atmosp
hericAdmin
istration,
usingwind and ocean-temperature data

collected since 1947. In it, DrKossin shows

thatthe intensityo
fhurricaneswhich
make landfall in the United Statestends to

be lowestwhen the Atlantic’sstorm-gener-

ation system isatitsmostactive. 
In DrKossin’sview, the cause ofthis ap-
parentparadoxisthat,
 when conditions in
the deep Atlantic
conspire to 
produce the
mosthurricanes, pr
ecisely
the oppositeconditionsobtain alongthe American

coast. Thatcreatesa berzone which low-

ersthe i
ntensityofinc
omingstorm
sbefore
theymake landfall. T
he agentre
sponsibleforthisloweringo
fintensityi
svertical
wind shear—in otherwords, wind speeds

and directionsthatvarygreatlywith alti-

tude. Vertical wind shearremovesenergy

from hurricanesbypullingheatand mois-

ture outofa storm’scentre. When the At-

lanticisin itshurric
ane-producin
gphase,
with lowwind shearand high surface tem-

peraturesin itscentral region, the part

alongthe American coastbehavesin the

opposite manner, with high
 wind shear
and lowsurface temperaturesthatsap

storms’ energy.
The obverse isalso true. When wind
shearand sea-surface temperatureskeep

the Atlantic’shurricane-generatingregion

quiet, astheydid between 1970 and 1992,

those stormswhich do appearare two to

three timesmore likelyto intensifyrapidly

(deﬁned asgaining15 knotsofwind speed

in sixhours) when theyare nearthe coast

than isthe case duringactive periods. 
Noteveryone agr
eeswith DrKossin’s
proposed mechanism. JamesElsner, a ge-
ographeratFlorida State University, sug-

geststhatthe correlationsbetween storm

generation and storm strength atlandfall

which DrKossin observescould be ex-

plained anotherway. T
he biggeststorms
tend to startoutfarfrom land rather than

nearit, and duringperiodsofhigh activity

hurricanesare generated fartheroutin the

Atlanticthan happensduringlulls. These

distantstormsthushave more time to veer

north—pushed thatwayby
the interaction
between Earth’srotation and theirown, a

phenomenon called the Coriolisect—

and therefore avoid 
landfall a
ltogether.
Whateveritsphys
ical e
xplanation,though, the correlation lookssecure. And,

with the currentperiod ofactive hurricane

formation now24 yearsold, a lull, with ac-

companyingsuperstorms, maynotbe long

in coming. Time, perhaps, forothermayors

alongAmerica’sAtlanticcoastto follow Mr

de Blasio’sexample.

WHENin 1965 Vera Rubin arrived for a
four-daystinta
t“the mo
nastery”, asthe PalomarObservatory, home ofthe

world’slargesttelesc
ope, wasdubbed,
there were no women’slavatories. No fe-

male astronomerhad everworked there

before. Howcould they, when itwould

mean walking
home late atnight? 
Ithad been the same thinkingathigh
school. When she told herrevered science

teacherofherscholar
ship to Vassarhe
said: “Youshould do 
OK 
aslongasyoustay
awayfrom science.” She wasthe onlyas-

tronomymajorto gr
aduate there in her
year. When in 1947 she requested a gradu-

ate-school catalogue from Princeton, the

dean told hernotto bother: women were

notaccepted forphysicsand astronomy.

George Gamow,
 laterherdocto
ral adviser,
said she could notattend hislecture atthe

JohnsHopkinsApplied PhysicsLab “be-

cause wiveswere notallowed”.
She wasindeed a wife. She married—
aged 19—RobertRubin, a physicistwhom

she followed to Cornell, sacriﬁcingher

place atHarvard. He was, she said, her

greatestally. Later, when she attended

nightclassesatGeorgetown University, he

drove herthere, eatinghisdinnerin the car

until he could drive herhome, while her

parentsbaby-sat. Still, she found raising

fourchildren “almostoverwhelming”.
When she halted heracademiccareer—the
worstsixmonthsofherlife—she wept ev-

erytime the 
Astrophysical Journal 
arrived
in the house. But, workingp
art-time, she
made sure to be home when the kidsre-

turned from school. She neverinspected

theirrooms, she said, and theygrewup

ﬁne, all with 
PhDsin science ormaths. 
Hermaster’sthesiswas,
 herCornell su-
pervisorsaid, worthyofbeingpresented

to the American Astronomical Society. But

she wasaboutto give
 birth, so, 
he suggest-ed, he would presentit—butin hisname. 
She refused. Herparentsdrove up from
Washington and tooktheir22-year-old

daughter, nursing
hernewborn, on a gruel-
lingsnowytrip from upstate NewYork to

Philadelphia . She addressed the roomful

ofstrangersforten minutesaboutgalaxy

rotation, soaked up some patronisingcriti-

cism and a smidgen ofpraise—and left.
Though rowswere unpleasant, defeat
wasworse. “Protesteveryall-male meet-

ing, everyall-male department, every all-

male platform
,” she advised. 
AtPalomar,
she made a ladies’ room bystickinga

handmade skirtsign on a men’sroom door

(she returned a year
later: itwasgone).
She’d neveranticipated such problems.
Herfatherencourag
ed herc
hildhood habitofwatchingmeteorshowers, leaningout

ofherbedroom windowand memorising
theirgeometryin orderto lookthem up lat-
er. He even helped hermake herﬁrst tele-

scope, from a cardboard tube; she had al-

readymade herown kaleidoscope. She

hadn’tevermetan astronomer, butit never

occurred to herthatshe couldn’tbe one.
Butherearlyresearch waslargely ig-
nored. In otherwork, male astronomers el-

bowed her
aside. Fed up, she looked for a
problem “thatpeople would be interested

in, butnotso interested in thatanyone

would botherme before I wasdone.”
She found it. In the 1930sFritzZwicky,
an idiosyncraticSwissastrophysicist, had

suggested that
the brightlyshiningstars
represented onlya partofthe cosmic

whole. There 
mustalso 
be “dark
matter”,unseen butrevealed indirectlybythe ef-

fectsofitsgravity. Thatconjecture lan-

guished on the marginsuntil MsRubin,

workingwith hercolleague KentFord, ex-

amined the puzzle ofgalac
ticrotation. Spi-
ral galaxiessuch asAndromeda, she

proved, were spinningso fastthattheir

outerstarsshould be ﬂyingawayinto the

never-never. Theyweren’t. So eitherEin-

stein waswrongaboutgravity, orgravita-

tional pull from vastamountsofsome-

thinginv
isible—dark
matter—washolding
the starstogether.
The discoveryreshaped cosmology,
though initiallyhercolleaguesembraced it

unenthusiastically. Astronomershad
thoughttheywere studyingthe whole uni-

verse, notjusta sm
all luminousf
raction of
it. Newtheoriesdeveloped on whatthe

mattermightbe—butitsfugitive particles

escaped all directdetection. 
Some are worried bythe absence. Ms
Rubin wasunbothered. Astronomy, she

reckoned, was“outofkindergarten, but

onlyin aboutthe third grade”. Manyofthe

universe’sdeep mysteriesremained to be

discovered byeye and brain, with 
all thejoythatinvolved. 
Shining a light
There were otherscien
tiﬁcfeats,
 too: in1992 she discovered
NGC 
4550, a galaxyin
which halfthe starsorbitin one direction,

mingled with halfthathead the other way.

She won medalsaplenty: the Gold Medal

ofBritain’sRoyal Astronomical Society

(lastawar
ded to a woman in 1828) and
America’sNational Medal ofScience.

Princeton, which had once shunned her,

wasamongthe manyuniversitiesto award

heran honorarydo
ctorate. 
She gave nota-
ble commencementspeeches.
The plauditswere pleasant, butnum-
bersmattered more: the greatestcompli-

mentwould be ifastronomersyearshence

still used herdata, she i
nsisted. She wasa
perennial favourite fora Nobel prize in

physics—onlyeverawarded to two wom-

lack of Brexit plans, page 41.

1WITHINhoursofthe Brexit
referend
um lastsummerDavid Cameron had resigned,

and within three weeksTheresa

Mayhad succeeded him as

prime minister. 
The speed of her
ascentto power, on July13th

2016, withouta general election
ora full-blown Toryleadership contest, meantthatMayism

wasneverspeltoutin anymanifesto orendorsed bythe elec-

torate. Yet
the newprime min
istersoon made clearthe scale of
herambitionsforBritain. Notonlywould she make a success

ofBrexit, she would also setin motion a sea-change in social

mobilityto corr
ectthe “b
urningi
njustices” faced bythe down-
trodden, and reshape “the forcesofliberalism and globalisa-

tion which have held sway...acrossthe Western world.” Heral-

liestalked ofan epochal moment, comparable to Margaret

Thatc
her’sbreakwith the p
astin 1979
. The feeble condition of
the Labouropposi
tion gave MrsMaycontrol ofa one-party
state. Asforher
mandate, s
he cited the refe
rendum: a “quiet
revolution” bypeople “notprepared to be ignored anymore”.
Yetafterhalfa yeare there isstrikingly little to show
forthisMayrevolution (see 
pages14-16). The strategyforBrexit,
which isdue to be triggered in lessthan three months, remains

undeﬁned in anybutthe vaguestterms, and seemsincreasing-

lychaotic. Athome, the grand talkabouttransforming society

and tamingcapitalism hasyielded onlytimid proposals, many

ofwhich have alreadybeen scaled down orwithdrawn. The

growingsusp

Sphinx-like p

MrsMaybuilta reputation for
dogged c
ompetence d

political careers. She skilfullysurvived the Brexitreferendum

despite backingthe losingside.
 In the abbreviat
ed Conserva-
tive leadership race she stood outasthe onlygrown-up; few

Toriesregretplumpingforheroverthe unprepared and unseri-

ousothercontenders. In negotiatingBrexit, the hardest taskfor

anyprime min
isters
ince the second world war, she faces a
powerful drain on political capital and governmental capacity.

Halfthe countryisagainstthe idea and the restmay souronce

itsdrawbacksmaterialise. Most
ofthe civil serv
ants imple-mentingBrexitthinkita mistake. IfBritain’snextfewyearswill

be aboutavoidingtraps, then the warytenacityofMrs May

could be justwhat
the countryneeds.
Yetcaution hasstarted to looklike indecision. Her mostse-
nior

ernmentdoesnothave a clearBrexitplan (see 
page 41). After

The cause ofthisdisarraycould be thatMayism itself is
muddled. While vowingto make Britain “the strongestglobal

advocate forfree markets”, 
the prime ministerhasal

Consi

Acitizen ofnowhere
There isone lesson in the overdone comparison ofMrs Mayto

Thatcher
. The woman who reallydid
 transform Britain had a
shambolicﬁrst
term; priv
atisation and union ref
orm, withwhich she isnowassociated, did notreallygetgoing until after
1983. Angela Merkel also made a shakystartasGermany’s
chancellor. MrsMaycould yetﬁnd herfeet—and given the state

ofLabour, she will have time to do so, ifBrexitdoes notpro-

vide herown partywith a reason to ousther.
YetMrsMaycould turn outto resemble another, less obvi-
ouspredecessor: Gordon Brown. He, too, wasthin-skinned.

Like her, he moved into DowningStreetwithoutan election, in

2007. He also started with a fearsome reputation and big

promises. And when itbecame clearhe had little idea whatto

do with the job he had so 
coveted, he ﬂopped. The ﬁnancial
crisisparalysed hisgov
ernmentbecause of
hisdesire 
to micro-
manage everydecision. 
There ismore than a little ofthisin MrsMay. One person
can justabout
e sing
le-handed. But beingprime ministerreq
uiresdelegation—especi
allywhen Brexit
loomsso large. Care forthe elderlyisfraying. The National

Health Service isrunningoutofmoney. Ahousingshortage is

worsening. Scotland and Northern Ireland are raisingawk-

ward constitutional questions. Aslongaseveryproposal has

to be pored overbythe prime min
ister, ra
dical decisions ofthe
sortneeded to solve these problemswill notbe taken. To geta

grip on Britain, MrsMay
mustle
arn to loosen hers.
Forthis, s
he mustdecide what
the grand promisesof her
governmentactuallyamountto. The need foreverypolicy to

be agonised overin DowningStreet, the secrecyoverBrexit

and the silence on the government’sbroaderplansforBritain

all pointto the same problem: Theresa Maybe doesnot really

knowwhatshe wants.

1ASAstudentatOxford, Theresa May
looked like a typic

berofthe Oxford UniversityConservative

Association; itwasatone ofitsdiscos that

BenazirBhutto
, laterthe prime minister ofPakistan, introduced herto the man she

would marry. She also joined the Oxford

Union, a debatingsocietywhere politi-

ciansin embryo learn to speechify, ingrati-

ate themselvesand stab each otherin the

back. She told a tutorial partnerthat she

wanted to be 
prime minister. 
Yetvariousthingsdistinguished her
from the c
lassicToryha

notread philosophy, politicsand econom-

ics(
PPE

elites. She read geography. ForDavid Wil-

letts, who wasmin
isterfor
universities in
the 2010-15 coalition governmentin which

MrsMaywashome secretary, thisdistinc-

tion ismore than incidental. 
He notesthat
PPE
ists(like Da
vid Camer-
on, MrsMay’spredecessor, and indeed

Lord Willetts) tend to concentrate on Brit-

ain’ssectoral strengths—itsboomingser-

vice i
ndustries, itsgrea
tuniversities, the
City—whose successmighttrickle down to

poorerareas, orinto whose orbitresidents

ofpoorerareasmig

places, theirpreservation and people’sat-

tachmentto them, an attitude which

makesherparticularlyconcerned with

down-and-outareasthatneed help pick-

ingthemselvesup. 
In thisshe iswell-suited to her times.
